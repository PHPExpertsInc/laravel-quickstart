# Laravel QuickStart
### A PHP Experts, Inc., Project

Everything you need to start a production-ready Laravel+PostgreSQL+jQuery+Bootstrap system, in 5 minutes or less! 

Is it really possible to start a new Laravel project, completely from scratch, and be operational, complete with a Dockerized PHP, Nginx, PostgreSQL and Redis environment that's ready for either a devbox or production environment...

   In less than 5 minutes?

Now it is!

tl;dr: To get started, just do this:

    git clone https://github.com/phpexpertsinc/laravel_quickstart.git
    cd laravel_quickstart
    ./install.sh

Follow the prompts. And you'll be done in under 5 minutes! A complete Linux, Nginx, PostgreSQL and PHP (LEPP) stack + Redis. MariaDB and Memcache will be coming soon!

## Features: ##

1. Shortens the time to start a fresh Laravel site from 1-3 hours to 3-5 minutes.
2. Full dockerized webstack ready for deployment on either dev boxes or docker cloud hosts, like Google App Engine.
3. Uses the latest version of PHP, v7.2.2.
4. Instantly available, pre-configured Laravel installation, using PostgreSQL and Redis.
5. Template layouts are already installed.
6. Laravel's authentication system is already installed and configured.
7. **Requires no knowledge of Laravel, Docker, or even PHP.** So it's great for people who are just beginning.
7. Fully scriptable and ready for CI builds.

## Live webapp deployment in minutes ##

This script requires absolutely no skill to setup the entire system. If you want to deploy it to, say, a [DigitalOcean Docker Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/docker/?refcode=724f89bd9417), all you would have to do is, literally, upload your project to the server and then run the `./install.sh` and you'd instantly have a live server. How cool is that?!

## Inspiration ##

This directly builds upon my new project [**DockerPHP**](https://vimeo.com/254179137), which I made and released yesterday. It allows you to dockerize any PHP app in under 5 minutes, by, again, two simple commands that require very little to no skill.

This is definitely easier than setting up a Wamp server. And faster, too!

This project took me about 6 hours to create and another 4 to polish it, all in one day and ALLL night! Normally, it takes about 2 or 3 hours for me to bring a project to this level of development, **but now the installer does everything in under 3 minutes!**
