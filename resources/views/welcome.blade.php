    <h1>The Laravel QuickStart Project</h1>
    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>
        Weclome to the Laravel QuickStart Project! Here we aim to create an already-configured
        and ready-to-go Laravel installation, complete with several modern web technologies,
        including jQuery and Bootstrap.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to shave off roughly 1 to 3 hours of work you would otherwise
        spend initially setting up a common HTML5 Laravel project.
    </p>
    <p>
        See our <a href="https://github.com/phpexpertsinc/laravel_quickstart" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub repo</strong></a>
        for more information!
